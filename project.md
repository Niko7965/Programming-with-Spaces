# Project management plan

## Objectives

The following table lists the main objectives of the pSpace project order by their urgency.

| Objective | Priority | Effort |
| - | - | - |
| Reliability | high | medium|
| Maintainability |  medium | low |
| Interoperability | high | medium/high |
| Security | medium/high | medium |
| Performance | low/medium  | high |
| Enhancements | low | high |

* Urgency: what needs to be addressed first.
* Objective: a desired property/capability of pSpaces.
* Priority: how important the objective is.
* Effort: predicted effort as the project grows, that his how the effort required to maintain or enrich the objective grows keep new features are being added. 

## Tasks

We list here some tasks that need to be carried out to achieve the desired goals:

Reliability
