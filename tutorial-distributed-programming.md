# 3. Distributed Programming with Tuple Spaces

This chapter provides a gentle introduction to distributed computing using pSpaces. In the [previous chapter](tutorial-concurrent-programming.md) we explained how spaces can be used to support concurrent programming, where several processes on the same machine communicate and cooperate using one or several shared tuple spaces. In distributed systems, processes and data repositories are spread among several devices possibly far away from each other. This chapter explains how to make spaces accessible from remote applications.

## 3.1 Space repositories
Space repositories are used organise and control how spaces are exposed to external applications. Each space in a repository must be univocally identified by a name. The following Java code can be used to create a repository and add two chat rooms in the same repository:

```java
SpaceRepository chatRepository = new SpaceRepository();
chatRepository.Add("room123",New SequentialSpace());
chatRepository.Add("room456",New SequentialSpace());
```

## 3.2 Gates
One of the purposes of using space repositories is to ease the exposure of spaces that need to have the same kind of external access. Each way to access all spaces within a repository is called a *gate*. A gate can be thought of as a communication port and it is identified by an URI of the form:

```
<protocol>://<address>:<id>/?<par1>&...&<parn>
```

where `<protocol>` identifies the communication protocol, `<address>` is a string identifying the local port used to accept requests, `<id>` is an integer, and `<par1>`,..., `<parn>` are extra parameters that can be used to configure the interaction protocol.

Currently, most pSpace implementations provide support for `tcp` only but some implementations plan to support `udp`, `bt` (bluetooth) and `http`. The fields `<address>` and `<id>` depend on the protocol.  In the case of `tcp`, `<address>` can be the network address of the local network interface used for the communication and  `<id>` the *socket port* used to accept connections, while ```<pari>``` can be used to select the format used to serialise data (e.g. `keep` to keep connections open or `conn` to open a new connection for every tuple space operation).

Following on our example, the server of chat rooms can open a gate for Alice and her friends with

```java
chatRepository.AddGate("tcp://localhost:31415/?keep");
```

Then Alice and her friends con connect to it with

```java
RemoteSpace chat = new RemoteSpace("tcp://chathost:31415/room123?keep")
```

## 3.3 Accesing a remote space

A remote tuple space, possibly residing on another device, accepts the same operations as a local tuple space. The only difference is that we need to create the space slightly differently, namely with the `NewRemoteSpace` constructor.

In our example, Alice and her friends can implement clients that connect to the server running in `chathost` in Go with:

```go
chat := NewRemoteSpace("tcp://chathost:3115/room123")
```

after which the space `chat` can be treated as an ordinary tuple space. For example, messages can be sent with 

```go
chat.Put("Alice","Hi!")
```

Remote spaces are accessed similarly in libraries supporting repositories and gates.

## 3.4 What can be send around?

There are limitations on the datatypes that can be used in the remote tuple space operations, partly due to the underlying serialisers used by the libraries. Currently the limitations are language dependent. Some examples are:

* Java: current support is mainly limited to JSON (see [serialization in jSpace](https://github.com/pSpaces/jSpace/blob/master/docs/jspace_serialization.md))
* Go: current support is mainly limited to datatypes serializable by [gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/)
* C#: current support is limited to primitive datatypes.

Some examples of common restrictions are:
* datatypes should be known on both sides.
* references and pointers cannot be sent, typically the pointed/reference data will be send.

## 3.5 A simple message board

Suppose that Alice and her friends want to create a simple chat server to communicate with each other. The server will just host a tuple space for all messages to be collected and it will take care of displaying the messages on a shared screen. The server can create such a space in Go with

```go
chat := NewSpace("tcp://localhost:31415/room123")
```

Once created, the server can keep retrieving and printing messages with

```go
var who string
var message string
for {
  t, _ := chat.Get(&who, &message)
  who = (t.GetFieldAt(0)).(string)
  message = (t.GetFieldAt(1)).(string)
  fmt.Printf("%s: %s \n", who, message)
}
```

## 3.6 A coordination pattern: private spaces

A typical coordination pattern in distributed programming is the creation of fresh contexts for private conversations (e.g. sessions in communication protocols). We illustrate this pattern with our example of the chat server. The main idea is that the server will host a `lounge` space to receive requests to enter specific chatrooms from the Alice and her friends and will reply to those requests with the URI of the space used to handle the corresponding chatroom.

More in detail, Alice and her friends can request to enter a room by placing a request `("enter", name, roomID)` specifying the identifier `roomID` of the room and then waiting for a reply from the server. The reply contains the URI of the space they need to connect to start chatting:

```go
lounge.Put("enter", name, roomID)
t,_ := lounge.Get("roomURI", name, roomID, &uri)
uri = (t.GetFieldAt(2)).(string)
room := NewRemoteSpace(uri)
```

The server keeps the list of existing room identifiers and their associated port numbers. If a client requests to enter an existing room then the server builds the URI based on port number associated to the room. Otherwise, a new space is created at a fresh URI and a process `show` is spawned to handle the chat room. In both cases, the server replies with the URI of the space that is used to handle the requested chat rooom:

```go
for {
  t, _ := lounge.Get("enter", &who, &roomID)
  who = (t.GetFieldAt(1)).(string)
  roomID = (t.GetFieldAt(2)).(string)
  _, ok := rooms[roomID]
  if ok {
    roomURI = "tcp://" + host + ":" + strconv.Itoa(rooms[roomID]) + "/" + roomID
  } else {
    rooms[roomID] = chatPort
    chatPort++
    room := NewSpace(roomURI)
    go show(&room, roomID)
  }
  lounge.Put("roomURI", who, roomID, roomURI)
}
```

## 3.7 A coordination pattern: remote procedure call

Strong forms of code mobility based on sending actual code are currently not supported. This is one of the main reasons why operations such as atomic updates or  conditional pattern matching (i.e, pattern matching enriched with additional predicates as in SQL'a `WHERE` clauses) are not currently supported. However, softer forms of code mobility can obtained. An example are remote procedure calls (RPCs).

Suppose, for example, that Alice and her friends needs to compute functions such as `foo(1,2,3)` and `bar("a","b")` and want a server to do the job for them. They can send their RPC requests by first sending the function name and the arguments in separate tuples and then waiting for the result:

Client
```go
server.Put("Alice1", "func", "foo")
server.Put("Alice1", "args", 1, 2, 3)
var u int
t,_ := server.Get("Alice1", "result", &u)
```

The server process the RPCs of Alice and her friends by getting the function to be executed first and retrieving the arguments (of the right types) then. It would then invoke the function and send back the result to the callee:

```go
for {
  t,_ := mySpace.Get(&callID, "func", &f)
  callID = (t.GetFieldAt(0)).(string)
  f = (t.GetFieldAt(2)).(string)
  switch f {
  case "foo":
    t,_ := mySpace.Get(callID, "args", &x, &y, &z)
    result := foo((t.GetFieldAt(2)).(int), (t.GetFieldAt(3)).(int), (t.GetFieldAt(4)).(int))
    mySpace.Put(callID, "result", result)
  case "bar":
    t,_ := mySpace.Get(callID, "args", &a, &b)
    result := bar((t.GetFieldAt(2)).(string), (t.GetFieldAt(3)).(string))
    mySpace.Put(callID, "result", result)
  default:
    // ignore RPC for unknown functions
    continue
  }
}
```

Note that a mechanism is needed to uniquely identify the RPCs. In the above example we are using the first field of the tuples as identifier for the RPCs but one could also use private spaces as seen above. The server in the above example can of course be made more sophisticatd, e.g. by handling the RPCs asynchronously or dealing with calls to unknown functions differently.

## Summary
 
We have seen the following operations to access remote spaces:
- `RemoteSpace`: constructor to create a local reference to a remote space specified by an URI.
- `Repository`: a collector of spaces.
- `addSpace`: operation to add a space to a space repository.
- `addGate`: operation to open a gate (external access) to a space repository.

We have seen the following coordination patterns:
- Private space creation.
- Remote procedure calls.
