This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to programming with spaces. We mostly use the [Java](https://github.com/pSpaces/jSpace) and [Go](https://github.com/pSpaces/goSpace) libraries in the code examples, but most explanations are generic and can be easily adapted to other programming languages. The [naming table](https://github.com/pSpaces/Programming-with-Spaces/blob/master/naming.md) summarises the main features of the libraries and can be used as a quick reference to adapt the examples of the tutorial. 

The chapters of the tutorial are:
1. [Programming with Spaces](tutorial-tuple-spaces.md)
2. [Concurrent Programming with Spaces](tutorial-concurrent-programming.md)
3. [Distributed Programming with Spaces](tutorial-distributed-programming.md)
